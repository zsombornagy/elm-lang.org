        let lower  = filter (\n -> n <= pivot) rest

{---------------------

QuickSort works as follows:

 - Choose a pivot element to put in the "middle" of the sorted list.
 - Gather all of the elements less than the pivot in `lower`.
 - Gather all of the elements greater than the pivot in `higher`.
 - Run `quicksort` on the `lower` and `higher` lists, sorting them.
 - Put the sorted lists together.


Note that choosing a bad pivot can have bad effects. Take a sorted
list with N elements. The pivot will always be the lowest member,
meaning that it does not divide the list very evenly. The list of
lessers has 0 elements and the list of greaters has N-1 elemens.
This means quicksort will be called N times, each call looking
through the entire list. This means, in the worst case, QuickSort
will make N^2 comparisons.
